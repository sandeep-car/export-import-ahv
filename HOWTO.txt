# If pip here failed because of a weird SSL error, it means one of two things:
# 1. Your ~/.bashrc wasn't updated properly, or it wasn't sourced. Update and  . ~/.bashrc
# 2. Your openssl/python build failed, probably because you didn't source ~/.bashrc. Update your ~/.bashrc, re-source it and start over.
